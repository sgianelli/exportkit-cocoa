ExportKit offers a simple, user friendly implementation for various services including (as of this writing):

-Bluetooth file transfers

-PDF creation

-TwitPic uploading

-TwitVid uploading

-Imgur uploading

-Pikchur uploading

This is written entirely in Objective-C with NO other 3rd party code, it is entirely based on the Foundation framework.  Currently, I am planning on adding other services:

-YFrog

-Imageshack

-whatever you think we need

I currently have this running on the iPhone but will work to ensure that it works on Mac OS X too.
